# PROJECT 3

# OVERVIEW
## In this assignemnt I used a bounding box around the United States
## and from that we generate random points around the edge of the bounding box
## Once we get these points we get all non repeating combinations from these points
## These combinations are then turned into multi point line strings 
## And then saved into a table where all these paths will be stored
## We will also store the area for the 50 largest military bases in a seperate table
## with the idea behind it being to find if these lines intersect any of the locations of the military bases

# Requirments:
## PostgreSQL
## psycopg2
## python3
